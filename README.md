## Hi there! I'm Daniel. ðŸ‘‹

### I enable ***data-driven decisions*** by working at the intersection of requirements and software engineering.

I finished my B.Sc. in 2014, my M.Sc. in 2016, and my Ph.D. in 2020 (with high honors) â€” all in computer science. I had the privilege of working with [Walid Maalej](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMbIVBb1Ap0) on my Ph.D. thesis, titled [Improving the Quality of User Feedback for Continuous Software Evolution](https://ediss.sub.uni-hamburg.de/volltexte/2020/10470/pdf/Dissertation.pdf).

To enable companies take data-driven decision, I use the most recent technologies from the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for analyzing un-/structured explicit user data, such as emails or tweets, as well as implicit user data, e.g., in the form of user interactions.

In addition, I have a strong industrial background as a software engineer in the development of mobile and web applications. I have 10+ years of experience working for software companies, European research projects, digital agencies, and startups where I developed 30+ top-rated and awarded (mobile) apps.
